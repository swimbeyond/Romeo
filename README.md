# Romeo
Android app providing word stats for Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet

Potential future improvements:
1. Modularization of the app
2. Counting various grammatical forms of the same word together (E.g. "do" and "did", "thou" and "thee", "Romeo" and "Romeo's). This would provide better stats but would also require more anvanced word processing.
3. Integration tests
